      <p id="about"> I am currently a junior at the University of Miami in the Herbert Business School, studying marketing with minors in management and theater. From a young age I really enjoyed the entertainment industry and knew that I wanted to one day be immersed in that work. Therefore, by pairing these three areas of study I have the ability to really grasp knowledge in each discipline and hopefully put them together for the future. My dream job would to be doing social media marketing for movies or a big fashion company. Marketing is fun for me because I enjoy analyzing trends, and utilizing technology like social media to create consumer awareness and maintain engagement. For the time being, I am living in Miami during the school year and spending the summer split between NY on the weekdays and my hometown in NJ on the weekends. I want to eventually move to LA and work out there. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, going to the beach, trying new restaurants and taking photographs! A little fun fact about me is I am obsessed with coffee and love trying new coffee shops, so one day I hope to own my own coffee shop. </p>
